Abstract 
 
 
 
Internal Guide R&D Coordinator HOD 
This project develops an AI-powered Legal Research Assistant tailored for Indian 
law,simplifying access to judgments and statutes through Retrieval-Augmented 
Generation(RAG). The system enables natural language queries, delivers concise case 
summaries,and recommends relevant precedents using semantic vector search. It also 
provides drafting support with legal templates and multilingual capability.Leveraging 
vector stores (Pinecone) for retrieval, relational databases for metadata, and Neo4j for 
citation networks, as well as LLMs for summarization and drafting, the solution is 
modular, scalable, and enhances the efficiency of Indian legal research.
